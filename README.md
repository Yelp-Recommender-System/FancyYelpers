## Data:

Yelp Open Dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset)

## Overview:

The advent of crowd-sourcing review platforms makes business information readily accessible for customers. Yet, as the number of choices becomes overwhelming, there is need to filter, prioritize and personalize relevant information in order to alleviate the information overload. In this paper, we build a Yelp restaurant recommender system to provide users with personalized restaurant recommendations. We build popular collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) methods which consider user-business interactions, restaurant attributes and text mining of user reviews. We also construct the state-of-the-art LightFM hybrid model which unites the advantages of content-based and collaborative filtering recommenders and thus significantly improves the predictive power. Our framework to build the outperforming recommenders serves as a practical guide to help the platform provide commercial restaurant recommendation service.
